Completed as part of MIT xPro's Professional Coding Certificate: Fullstack Development with MERN

## Description
This project comes in two parts. 
The first being one dimensional motion of a circle back and forth across the window.
The second being two dimensional motion of multiple circles within the bounds of the window.

## Downloading/Installation
The repo can be cloned and run on a users local machine, but is closed for public pull requests.

To clone the project just run
```
git clone https://github.com/mbonazzoli/one-dimensional-motion
```
Otherwise, the projects .zip is available for download.

## Run the apps

* To run the one dimensional circle movement, open the moveBall.html in your browser.
* To run the two dimensional circle movement, open the moveBall_bonus.html in your browser.

## Two dimensional ball movement
To add additional balls on the screen open up the dev console and run the function `addBall()`
